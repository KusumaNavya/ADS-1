Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort?

When keys in an array are in reverse order, selection sort works better and faster than the insertion sort because the number of exchanges are less in selection sort when compared to insertion sort.
Selection sort
array : [ 5 4 3 2 1]
i 	min		array keys				exchange
0	1		1	4	3	2	5			5	1
1	2		1	2	3	4	5			4	2
2	3		1	2	3	4	5			3	3
3	4		1	2	3	4	5			4	4
4	5		1	2	3	4	5			5	5
