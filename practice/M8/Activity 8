Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort?

When keys in an array are identical, insertion sort is better because it takes only 1 comparison and zero exchanges ehile in selection sort comparison and exchanges are made n time.

i=0		1	1	1	1	1
j=1		0---1	2	3	4

i=1		1	1	1	1	1
j=2		0	1---2	3	4

i=2		1	1	1	1	1
j=3		0	1	2---3	4

i=3		1	1	1	1	1
j=4		0	1	2	3---4
