Give the sequence of subarray sizes in the merges performed by both the top-down and the bottom-up merge sort algorithms, for N = 39.

Top-down mergesort: 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 10, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 10, 20, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 10, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2, 4, 9, 19, 39.
Bottom-up mergesort: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 16, 16, 32, 39.
