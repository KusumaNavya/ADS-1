There are 4 different techniques to solve the given problem. They are -
1. Quick find
2. Quick Union
3. Weighted Quick Union
4. Weighted Quick Union with Path Suppression

Weighted quick union with path compression is the best way in solving for the following reasons -
1. The complexity of this method is O(log N).
2. It can take up to 2 to the exponent of 65536 inputs and compute them in 6 seconds.
3. It makes the final tree as flat as possible. This reduces the time taken to traverse the final tree.
